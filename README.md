# My Boot.dev Python Journey

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes as I work through the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) Python curriculum.

I'm using this as a personal learning log to track my progress, practice using Git, and build my portfolio.

**Note:** These are my own solutions for learning purposes. They are not intended as an answer key or for distribution.
